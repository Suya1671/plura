## AI Usage in this project
(_Required for Summer Of Making by Hack Club_)

- General autocompletion tooling (i.e. Zed edit predictions)
- Initial draft of the merge_trigger_fields migration was done by AI
  - This also included editing matching structs
  - This has been refactored and edited by Suya1671
- Initial draft of trigger commands was done by AI
  - Note that this has been completely redone and nearly no AI-generated code remains. Suya1671 remade triggers to have an entirely command based interface.
- General code analysis was done by AI to make sure it's easier to understand and maintain the project
  - No code edits were made, only suggestions which were implemented if seen fit by Suya1671
